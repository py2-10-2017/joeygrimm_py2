"pip install Djando-This command install the Python library for Django, which is a Python web framework. pip list- This give you a list of the install Python packages/libraries. pip install Django-this command ran for the second time just displays that we have already install the package. pip freeze- This appears to do the same thing as pip list. However when I look up the differences between the two, I am told that it outputs installed packages in the requirements format. pip uninstall Django- This simply uninstalled the Python package. pip show Django- This will show if the package is installed, and when ran in my circumstance it showed the Django did exist since I had deleted it prior. pip search Flask- This command searched for Python packages named Flask."
